## What is Horizon System?
**Horizon System** is an integrated **Enterprise Project Management (EPM)** platform that unifies project oversight, financial tracking, and employee performance evaluation.
It helps organizations measure both **operational efficiency** and **team well-being**, aligning productivity with ethical and human-centered values.
Horizon empowers decision-makers to enhance outcomes while promoting transparency, fairness, and human dignity in the workplace.

## How Does Horizon System Work?
Horizon System assesses job satisfaction and performance using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. Key approaches include:

1. **Employee Surveys & Feedback:** Regular surveys help gather insights on job satisfaction, workplace culture, and team dynamics.
2. **Project Workflow Analysis:** By tracking task completion times, collaboration patterns, and workload distribution, the system identifies areas for improvement.
3. **Performance Metrics:** The system evaluates productivity trends and employee engagement based on real work data.
Ethical & Social Impact Indicators – Workplace inclusivity, work-life balance, and adherence to labor rights standards are measured to ensure a fair work environment.

By integrating these methods, Horizon System provides actionable insights for both employees and managers, fostering a healthier and more efficient work environment.

## Horizon Extension Engine
To minimize redundant manual input and maximize interoperability, Horizon introduces the Extension Engine — a lightweight, pluggable integration system that connects your existing tools and workflows directly to Horizon’s core analytics platform.

With Horizon Extension Engine, you can effortlessly sync data from popular platforms, such as:

1. GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket – for project and development metrics
2. Jira, Trello, Asana – for task and workflow tracking
3. Google Sheets, Excel, Notion – for financial or resource-related data
4. Email & Calendar tools – to estimate communication loads and time allocation
5. Custom APIs & internal systems – for tailored enterprise integrations

**Key Features:**
1. Modular Plug-ins: Install only what you need. Each connector works independently.
2. Auto-sync & On-demand Pulling: Keep Horizon updated in real time or via scheduled syncs.
3. Secure & Minimal Footprint: Built with privacy and lightweight deployment in mind.
4. Customizable & Open Source: Easily extend with your own scripts or data adapters.

The Extension Engine allows Horizon to act not as another siloed system, but as a holistic analytical layer over your organization’s existing infrastructure — combining HR, financial, and project metrics into one coherent picture.
