<p style="font-style: italic;">Human-Centered Enterprise Project Management (EPM) Platform</p>
</div>

## What is Horizon System?
**Horizon** is an **Enterprise Project Management (EPM) platform** designed to ensure that organizations remain on a **sustainable development** path, not just in terms of delivery speed or cost control, but across people, performance, and long-term organizational health.

It combines project management, financial tracking, team performance evaluation, and employee satisfaction analysis into a single, integrated system. Horizon connects to existing tools such as GitHub, Jira, Trello, and spreadsheets to automatically collect project and team data and turn them into clear, actionable recommendations.

In short, Horizon helps organizations deliver projects efficiently while continuously validating that their practices support sustainable growth, fair treatment of employees, and long-term organizational stability.

## How Does Horizon System Work?
Horizon combines quantitative and qualitative analysis to generate meaningful insights for both managers and teams:

1. **Employee Surveys & Feedback** – Captures structured insights on motivation, team dynamics, and workplace culture.
2. **Project Workflow Analysis** – Monitors tasks, collaboration, and workload distribution to spot inefficiencies.
3. **Performance & Engagement Metrics** – Evaluates productivity trends and engagement using real project data.
4. **Ethical & Social Impact Indicators** – Assesses inclusivity, work-life balance, and adherence to labor rights standards.

These analyses are translated into clear, actionable recommendations, such as workload balancing, resource prioritization, or improving team collaboration.

## Why Horizon?
1. **Unified EPM Approach:** Combines project, financial, and human performance management in one platform.
2. **Human-Centered Insight:** Measures well-being alongside operational efficiency.
3. **Actionable Results:** Delivers recommendations based on real data.
3. **Ethical by Design:** Promotes fairness, transparency, and dignity at work.

## Extension Engine
Horizon includes an Extension Engine for integrating external tools or custom modules. Developers can connect services like Jira, Slack, or payroll systems, or create plugins to extend Horizon for organization-specific needs.
