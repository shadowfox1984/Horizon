## What is Horizon System?
**Horizon** helps project managers and PMOs detect early signs of employee dissatisfaction before they turn into quality issues, delivery risks, and unhappy customers.

Many organizations appear healthy on paper: timelines are met, costs are controlled, and performance metrics look green. Yet beneath these indicators, dissatisfaction and burnout quietly accumulate, eventually undermining quality and long-term stability.

Horizon is an **Enterprise Project Management (EPM) platform** designed to make these hidden risks visible. It **supports sustainable** development not only in terms of delivery speed or cost, but across people, performance, and organizational resilience.

By integrating project management, financial tracking, team performance evaluation, and employee satisfaction analysis into a single system, Horizon helps decision-makers understand the real impact of their practices. It connects to existing tools such as GitHub, Jira, Trello, and spreadsheets to automatically collect data and turn them into clear, actionable insights.

In short, Horizon enables organizations to deliver projects efficiently while continuously validating that their methods support sustainable growth, fair treatment of employees, and long-term organizational stability.

## A Real-World Scenario
A project portfolio shows strong delivery performance: milestones are met, costs are within budget, and velocity metrics look healthy. However, team turnover increases, code quality slowly degrades, and recurring issues appear across releases.

Horizon correlates delivery, financial, and team-level signals to highlight early patterns of dissatisfaction that are invisible in traditional reports. This allows PMOs to identify structural risks early and adjust practices before quality declines and customer satisfaction is affected.

## How Does Horizon System Work?
Horizon combines quantitative and qualitative analysis to generate meaningful insights for both managers and teams:

1. **Employee Surveys & Feedback** – Captures structured insights on motivation, team dynamics, and workplace culture.
2. **Project Workflow Analysis** – Monitors tasks, collaboration, and workload distribution to spot inefficiencies.
3. **Performance & Engagement Metrics** – Evaluates productivity trends and engagement using real project data.
4. **Ethical & Social Impact Indicators** – Assesses inclusivity, work-life balance, and adherence to labor rights standards.

These analyses are translated into clear, actionable recommendations, such as workload balancing, resource prioritization, or improving team collaboration.

## Why Horizon?
1. **Unified EPM Approach:** Combines project, financial, and human performance management in one platform.
2. **Human-Centered Insight:** Measures well-being alongside operational efficiency.
3. **Actionable Results:** Delivers recommendations based on real data.
3. **Ethical by Design:** Promotes fairness, transparency, and dignity at work.

## Extension Engine
Horizon includes an Extension Engine for integrating external tools or custom modules. Developers can connect services like Jira, Slack, or payroll systems, or create plugins to extend Horizon for organization-specific needs.
